## Synopsis
    
    
    void SPI_freetuple(HeapTuple _row_)
    

## Description

`SPI_freetuple` frees a row previously allocated in the upper executor context.

This function is no longer different from plain `heap_freetuple`. It's kept just for backward compatibility of existing code.

## Arguments

`HeapTuple _`row`_`
    

row to free
