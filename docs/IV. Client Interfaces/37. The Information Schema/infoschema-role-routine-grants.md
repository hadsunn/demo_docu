The view `role_routine_grants` identifies all privileges granted on functions where the grantor or grantee is a currently enabled role. Further information can be found under `routine_privileges`. The only effective difference between this view and `routine_privileges` is that this view omits functions that have been made accessible to the current user by way of a grant to `PUBLIC`.
